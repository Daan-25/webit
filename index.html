                Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital currency. It's an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. It's open source; its design is public, no one owns or controls Bitcoin, and everyone can participate.

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. It is the first decentralized cryptocurrency, released in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Unlike traditional currencies issued by central banks, Bitcoin is not controlled by a single authority. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, the blockchain, which records all transactions publicly and immutably.

                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                        The backbone of Bitcoin is the blockchain, a distributed ledger of all Bitcoin transactions ever executed. This ledger is continuously updated and accessible to everyone on the network, ensuring transparency and security.
                    </p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                        Bitcoin transactions are verified through a process called "mining." Miners use powerful computers to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. When a puzzle is solved, a new block of transactions is added to the blockchain, and the miner receives new Bitcoins as a reward.

                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                        To send and receive Bitcoin, you need a digital wallet. These wallets store your private keys, which are necessary to access your Bitcoins and authorize transactions. There are various types of wallets, including software wallets and hardware wallets.

                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                        A Bitcoin transaction is a digitally signed message broadcast across the network. It contains the input (where the Bitcoins come from), the output (where they are going), and an amount. Once verified by miners, the transaction is immutably recorded on the blockchain.
